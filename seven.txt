Engineering</h1>
<ol>
<li>Automated testing takes far less resources in execution as compared to manual testing.</li> <br>
<li>Automated testing has less chances of error hence more reliable.</li> <br>
<li>Automated testing reduces the dependability of testing on the availability of the test
engineers.</li> <br>
<li>Automated testing provides round the clock coverage as automated tests can be run all time in
24*7 environment.</li> <br>
<li>Automated testing improves the coverage of testing as automated execution of test cases is faster
than manual execution</li> <br>
<li>It helps to train the test engineers to increase their knowledge by producing a repository of
different tests. </li> <br>
